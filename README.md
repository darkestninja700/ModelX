A level Computer Science Project - Particle Physics Simulation

In order to use the software please click on play and input a variable into a field press the enter key once you have inputted it, repeat this for all variables until all fields are filled in for Class A then press Finish which will then automatically put you into Class B then repeat the process of variable input for Class B and press Finish (For colours the acceptable colours to choose from are ["Red","White","Blue","Black","Grey"] of which they are not case sensitive and any combination can be chosen . 

Upon pressing Finish you will then watch the simulation and can pause or unpause and see the effect or save and then press the esc key to return to the main menu and press load which will then bring you back to the simulation with the same variables you saved, reset will allow you to start the timer back to zero and return all variables to their initial pre-set to watch again. If you desire to change the variables and see what would happen you can also return to class A or class B and change them and start the simulation again

Once finished with the simulation press end and you will provided with a summary of what occurred in terms of collision in a table format which can help you track how certain variables influence the rate of collisions and the draw conclusions from running many different simulations such as how much the radius of particles affect rate of collision or how the number of particles affects it and the draw conclusions from graphs plotted from their relations (this would be done in separate graphing software of course).
